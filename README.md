# Coronavirus-EDA

### Project brief
---
This project used a comprehensive dataset that encompasses COVID-19 data from around the globe. This dataset includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations and other relevant variables that provide a holistic view of the pandemic's progression. Using SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server, an in-depth analysis was done on the dataset.

### Research questions
- Which are the 5 most affected countries in the world?
- Does latitude and longitude affect the number of cases?
- Which country has the highest death and recovery rate?
- Which date of every month recorded the highest number of cases in the world?
- Are the different parameters dependent on each other?
